üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Antivirus Fixes

Sometimes Windows or Antivirus may block parts of the script (like Tor, Privoxy, or Netcat). Here's how to fix it:


---

‚ùå Problem 1: Windows Defender or Antivirus deletes/block .exe files

Why? Tools like tor.exe, privoxy.exe, and nc.exe are command-line networking tools ‚Äî they might trigger antivirus even though they‚Äôre safe.

‚úÖ Fix:

1. Open Windows Security


2. Go to Virus & threat protection


3. Click Protection history


4. If you see something blocked (like tor.exe or privoxy.exe), click Allow


5. OR:

Go to Virus & threat protection settings

Scroll to Exclusions ‚Üí Add or remove exclusions

Add the whole folder where Codex IP Changer is extracted





---

‚ùå Problem 2: "Access Denied" or "Cannot Open File" Errors

Why? You didn‚Äôt run it as Administrator.

‚úÖ Fix:

Right-click codex-ipchanger-windows.exe

Select Run as Administrator



---

‚ùå Problem 3: Internet stops working after exiting

Why? Your system might still be routing traffic through the local proxy (127.0.0.1:8118)

‚úÖ Fix Options:

Re-run the tool and press [3] Exit properly

OR reboot your PC to reset all proxy settings

OR manually go to:

Settings ‚Üí Network & Internet ‚Üí Proxy

Turn off Manual proxy setup




---

‚ùå Problem 4: Curl or Netcat doesn't work

Why? Some antivirus blocks nc.exe or command-line tools

‚úÖ Fix:

Add the tool folder as Excluded in Windows Security

Or temporarily disable real-time protection (not recommended long-term)
